  title: Hancock's Future Should Center Equity
  description: >
    As the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department is planning for the
    future of Hancock Golf Course, it is critical for the department to engage
    with the broader Austin community to envision how this public space should
    be used. 


    We must envision a future for Hancock that provides equitable access to all, maximizes community benefit, and helps undo the marks of segregation and displacement that have shaped the Austin landscape for far too long.

        Prioritize public park space – Use the site to protect and create public
        park space that serves Austinites of all ages, abilities, and
        disabilities. Ecologically restore Waller Creek and expand hike and bike
        trails along it to serve the Austin community.

        Community Engagement - It is integral that there is broad community
        engagement and full transparency in guiding the transformation of this
        site, which so far has not been successfully accomplished. The future of
        the Hancock Golf Course must be decided by all Austinites, especially
        communities of color and working class communities who have historically
        been left out of such conversations.

        Retain and Expand Public Use - Do not create a private golf course that
        is exclusionary in nature and does not support Austin values. Instead
        the department should expand public use of the site and address broad
        community needs.

        Maximize Affordable Housing Opportunities - Maximize housing,
        particularly affordable housing opportunities, in this high opportunity
        area where residents have access to food, jobs, and other resources.
        Take advantage of the location of the site, in close proximity to
        transit infrastructure and Downtown Austin, to expand housing
        opportunities for historically segregated residents of color and working
        class residents.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...
